# Projects API GoStack 12 sample

This is a quick sample project made to run in node.

The database is just an array in memory.

Uses uuidv4 to handle unique IDs on resource creation.

## Requirements

* Node v12.x.x
* Yarn 1.x.x

## Setup development

Clone this repository, enter its directory and run:

```bash
yarn
```

## Test / dev with hot reload

Run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will invoke nodemon which restarts node at each file change saved.
