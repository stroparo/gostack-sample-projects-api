# Projects API GoStack 12 sample

This project implements a CRUD API to store information about projects with title and owner.

As this is just a sample it is simplified and information is stored only in memory (JavaScript array).

This was made by following classes about Node, in level 1 of the GoStack 12th edition by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), a major software development bootcamp in Brazil.

## Requirements

* Node v12.x.x
* Yarn 1.x.x

## Development Environment Setup

Clone this repository, enter its directory and execute this command in the shell/terminal:

```bash
yarn
```

### Hot Reload

Execute this command in the shell/terminal:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will invoke nodemon which will start node and keep restarting it upon each saved file change.
